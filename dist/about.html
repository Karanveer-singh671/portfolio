                        I'm a Computer Science major interested in full-stack web development and database design. 
                        I turned toward web development as an opportunity to improve my understanding of how websites are made 
                        and to appreciate the effort it takes to build one. My passion for continuous learning 
                        and growth has allowed me to really focus on improving myself, as well as, developing cleaner, and more robust code.

                    <h3>Create Music Group</h3>
                    <h4>Full Stack Developer - Business Intelligence Team </h4>
                    <p> 
                         Interfaced with and autonomously worked on the development of a large scale application for Youtube Asset Management using an MVC framework , which is currently being used to communicate data between three systems to submit content ownership claims, in turn earns Create Music Group ~55% of their revenue.

                        API-based backend written in PHP with Laravel and Symfony, using Doctrine and PostgreSQL.
                        
                         Set up migrations factories, seeds, indexes, web and api routes, created middleware and authentication, created the majority of classes, Laravel jobs, controllers, models and views in the system, Cron jobs and  wrote  automated tests using PHPUnit.  
                        
                         Learned how to write code for PHP memory management by streaming data.
                        
                         Wrote spec documents for a tool to develop a fully functional system within Laravel which can on-board assets into the Youtube CMS, including sound recordings, music videos, art tracks, and composition shares. The goal was to streamline the process of uploading files and filling out metadata. Resulting in 10% of their revenue.
                        
                         created  a tool from scratch that communicates with Youtube Content ID that allows you to receive certain records and their associated metadata depending specific filter conditions and saves them in a Posgresql DB. Then validates and compiles DDEX, XML and CSV then sends records to AWS buckets then from there for Youtube to process. 
                        
                         Coordinated closely with UI/UX, Design, and QA to make sure the system would be user-friendly and to minimize processing errors.
                        
                         Updated legacy PHP code base as well as restructured the backend PHP and Laravel code after architecture design changes to handle larger amounts of data streaming allowing for a 150% increase in the throughput of the system.
                        
                         Integrated AWS services such as S3, Cloudwatch as well as Google Cloud services such as Big Query within the system to handle large data flows.

                    <h3>UBC</h3>
                    <h4>Computer Science</h4>
                    <p>My degree included a variety of courses that gave me the opportunity to learn about many useful concepts 
                        from the software side like algorithms, data structures and programming to the hardware side such as Operating Systems 
                        and Compilers. The courses The courses I found to be the most impactful were the one's that taught about Relational
                         Databases from SQL to an RDBMS's optimizer as well as Artificial Intelligence. Learning about a few of the many 
                         different techniques an agent can use to understand it's environment like Q-learning, was a notable concept
                          to delve into.

                    <h3>Lighthouse Labs</h3>
                    <h4>Web Development Bootcamp</h4>
                    <p>The gruelling 3 months I spent at Lighthouse Labs was where I grew the most in a short time frame. By the end of the experience,
                         I felt like I could better utilize what I learned or was going to learn in my computer science degree.
                          The instructors, environment, and teaching style were all very conducive to knowledge retention and developing problem solving skills. 
                          The passion the instructors had for teaching and learning was something I could feed off of to fuel that my pursuit of learning. 
                          This place was where I started to understand how HTTP protocol worked, HTML5/CSS3, REST APIs, SQL querying, AJAX
                           and much more useful information. Not only were the instructor's able to conceptually explain the topics but they had 
                           clear-cut examples for everything they taught. They firmly believed in learning by doing. After completing the bootcamp 
                           and the project's each week, I felt like I had a better grasp of learning how to learn. Which resources to start with 
                           and which steps to take to master something new.</p>
