                        I'm a Computer Science major interested in full-stack web development and database design. 
                        I turned toward web development as an opportunity to improve my understanding of how websites are made 
                        and to appreciate the effort it takes to build one. My passion for continuous learning 
                        and growth has allowed me to really focus on improving myself, as well as, developing cleaner, and more robust code.

                    <h3>UBC</h3>
                    <h4>Computer Science</h4>
                    <p>My degree had a variety of courses offered. I had the opportunity to learn about many useful concepts from 
                        the software side like algorithms, data structures and programming to the hardware side 
                        such as Operating Systems and Compilers. The courses I felt I enjoyed and retained the most were the one's 
                        that taught about Relational Databases from SQL to an RDBMS's optimizer as well as Artificial Intellgence.
                        Learning about a few of the many different techniques an agent can use to understand it's environment like Q-learning, 
                        was really interesting to dwelve into.

                    <h3>Lighthouse Labs</h3>
                    <h4>Web Development Bootcamp</h4>
                    <p>The gruelling 3 months I spent at Lighthouse Labs was where I learned the most for that kind of time frame.
                        By the end of it I felt like I could better utilize what I learned or was going to learn in my computer science degree.
                         The instructors, environment, support and the way they taught was very motivating. The passion the instructors
                had for teaching and learning was beautiful and I could really feed off that passion in my pursuit for learning as well.
            This place was where I started to understand how HTTP protocol worked, HTML5/CSS3, REST APIs, SQL querying, AJAX and much more useful information.
        Not only were the instructor's able to conceptually explain the topics but they had clear-cut examples for everything they taught
         and preached about learning by doing. After completing the bootcamp and the project's each week, I felt like I had a better grasp of learning how to learn. Which resources
        to start with and which steps to take to master something new.</p>
